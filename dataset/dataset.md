# Dataset

The first dataset is a dataset composed by leaves images available 
on [Mendeley website](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hb74ynkjcn/1).

According to the dataset description:
> Principally, the complete set of images have been classified among two classes i.e. healthy and diseased. First, the acquired images are classified and labeled conferring to the plants. The plants were named ranging from P0 to P11. Then the entire dataset has been divided among 22 subject categories ranging from 0000 to 0022. The classes labeled with 0000 to 0011 were marked as a healthy class and ranging from 0012 to 0022 were labeled diseased class. We have collected about 4503 images of which contains 2278 images of healthy leaf and 2225 images of the diseased leaf. All the leaf images were collected from the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra. This process has been carried out form the month of March to May in the year 2019. The images are captured in a closed environment. This acquisition process was completely wi-fi enabled. All the images are captured using a Nikon D5300 camera inbuilt with performance timing for shooting JPEG in single shot mode (seconds/frame, max resolution) = 0.58 and for RAW+JPEG = 0.63. The images were in .jpg format captured with 18-55mm lens with sRGB color representation, 24-bit depth, 2 resolution unit, 1000-ISO, and no flash.
